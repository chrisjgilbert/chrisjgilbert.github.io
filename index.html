            <p class="brand-quote">"Nicola was always a wonderful energy in the office. Nothing was ever too much, no challenge too big, no job too small. She worked hard, led by example, wore a permanant smile and presented the brand to its best at all times."</p>

            <p class="brand-quote">"Nicola is a smart and creative thinker and I feel very lucky to count her as part of the Ernest Leoty team. She is extremely diligent, taking a practical and hands on approach to her work.
            It was very important for me to work with someone who had established relationships with key buyers, to help us successfully launch Ernest Leoty into the luxury and contemporary wholesale market, and Nicola has done just that, selling us into accounts like Matches, Selfridges and other accounts on an international basis.  Nicola is also strategic and understands the value of brand building and cash flow, advising us when to say no to accounts who are not in line with our brands, and when to push back on contractual terms. 
            She has an impressive and innate understanding of merchandising and brand positioning, and seems to know intuitively what buyers actually want to buy. 
            Despite the fact that Nicola works for us on a freelance basis she has integrated seamlessly and has formed excellent working relationships with the rest of the team."

Nicola has fantastic relationships with buyers and a positive energy which everyone likes to be around.  She has wonderful presentational and negotiating skills.  Her analytical ability is a huge asset to any business.""
